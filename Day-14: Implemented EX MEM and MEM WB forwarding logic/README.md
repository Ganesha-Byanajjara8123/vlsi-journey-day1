##Day 14 of my CPU Design Journey 🚀

Implemented data forwarding logic to resolve RAW hazards in a pipelined processor.

✅ EX/MEM forwarding
✅ MEM/WB forwarding
✅ Priority-based forwarding selection
✅ Verified via waveform-level simulation

This eliminates unnecessary stalls and improves pipeline throughput — a critical concept in real CPU microarchitecture.

Next: load-use hazards, stalling, and control hazards.
