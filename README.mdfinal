Project: Pipelined CPU with Hazard Detection

Overview
This project implements a simplified pipelined CPU architecture to demonstrate core micro-architecture concepts used in modern processors.

Key Features

Instruction Fetch (IF), Decode (ID), Execute (EX), Write-Back (WB)

Pipeline registers (IF/ID, ID/EX, EX/WB)

Load-use hazard detection (stall + flush)

Data forwarding unit (EX/MEM and MEM/WB)



Tools

Vivado-AMD

Learning Outcome
Gained hands-on experience in CPU micro-architecture, pipeline hazards, and verification-driven RTL design.
